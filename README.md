# Twitch2Go
Google chrome extension for viewing Twitch streams on any* page.
<br/><br/>
This extension doesn't work on some protected pages, such as GitHub and Facebook. There are more sites that aren't compatible with this extension, but it will work with most. Have fun!

Note: To drag the stream, please click and hold the drag bar at the top. The drag bar is where your stream title is with a smiley face. Your mouse cursor should change to a move icon when you are hovering it.
